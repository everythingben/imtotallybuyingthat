This inflatable predator swims/glides across any room as you guide its tail with the remote. You'll spend hours entranced by its realistic motion.

There are a lot of cool things to buy on Amazon but this shark will always be one of my favorites. It's perfect for parties. And it may scare young children, but let's be honest: that's half the fun.

Only four AAA batteries required.
