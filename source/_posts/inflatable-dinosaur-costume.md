This inflatable Tyrannosaurus Rex costume is one of the silliest things you can buy on the internet. It might scare small kids when you first zip it up, but start walking or running and the head flops backward. It's kind of hilarious.

The neck has a transparent viewport so you know when to dodge lamp posts and oncoming traffic. Comes with an attached battery-powered fan to maintain inflation.
