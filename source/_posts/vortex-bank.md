Remember those giant black hole contraptions at the mall where you sent your pennies rolling down into the darkness? This vortex bank will let you recapture that magic at home with the kids.

A great gift that will spark conversations about angular momentum, gravity, and wormholes, while also teaching kids to count and save money.

The bank is detachable, so no need to smash when you need to grab cash.
