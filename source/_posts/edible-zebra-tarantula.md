A zebra tarantula, dried and packaged with a sprinkling of BBQ seasoning. In some cultures, tarantulas and other arachnids are eaten out of necessity -- but judging by the reviews on Amazon, these things are actually pretty tasty. Great for truth or dare tournaments and impressing your friends. Bon appetit!
