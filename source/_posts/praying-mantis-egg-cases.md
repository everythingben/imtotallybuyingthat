Each of these two praying mantis egg cases produce approximately 200 baby mantids! The babies are really cute, though they still look like tiny aliens.

Kids will love them. Garden pests will hate them -- they are often used as a natural pesticide.

Just place the egg cases anywhere,then watch them hatch and grow.
