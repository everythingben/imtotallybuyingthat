It may not look like it, but the Otamatone is a real functioning musical instrument.

The technique is similar to guitar. One hand slides up and down the middle to produce sound and control frequency. The other hand squeezes the rubber cheeks to change volume and tone. It's really weird and fun.

Great gift for a child, or for a musician who already plays every other instrument.
